# TL;DR 🦄

This is Gina playing around with Object Oriented Programming in Ruby (as a ruby newbie)

# More Deets, Please

### File Names
libs: contains all the class (& subclass) files and main.rb
tests: contains all the test files (in this case there are 2 files per base class)

### Overview
There are 2 base classes:

The Office Characters 💼
The Warehouse Staff 📦
please note: If time permitted, I would have created a GIANT super class since these 2 base classes have similar methods

TheOfficeCharacter contains the following subclasses:

JimHalpert 😏
MichaelScott 🥴
DwightSchrute 🤓
TheWarehouseStaff contains the following subclasses:

RoyAnderson 😶
DarrylPhilbin 😒
NateNickerson 😛

main.rb creates the instances of these classes

🥰 ENJOY 🥰
